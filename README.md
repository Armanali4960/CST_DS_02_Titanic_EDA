# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🚀 This project is part of my **SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship (Task 02)**. It explores the Titanic dataset using Python, with a focus on identifying patterns and trends that influenced survival rates.

---

## 🔍 Task Objective

> Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Used `sns.load_dataset('titanic')` from Seaborn (similar to the Kaggle Titanic dataset).
- Contains data about passengers, including age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                      | Description                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `Titanic_EDA_Task2.py`        | Python script with all analysis     |
| `titanic.csv`                 | Sample or actual dataset (optional) |
| `Titanic_EDA_Charts_CST_DS_02.png` | Combined visualization output  |
| `README.md`                   | This documentation file             |

## 📈 EDA Visualizations

The script generates a 2x2 grid of EDA charts:
- **Survival Count**
- **Survival by Gender**
- **Age Distribution**
- **Correlation Heatmap**

> 📷 Output chart saved as: `Titanic_EDA_Charts_CST_DS_02.png`

## 🔎 Key Insights

- **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than **males**.
- Passengers from higher classes or who paid higher fares had better chances of survival.
- Most passengers were in their 20s and 30s.
