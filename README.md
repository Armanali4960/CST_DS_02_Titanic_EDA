# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🚀 This project is part of my **SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship (Task 02)**. It explores the Titanic dataset using Python, with a focus on identifying patterns and trends that influenced survival rates.

---

## 🔍 Task Objective

> Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Used Titanic dataset from Seaborn (`sns.load_dataset('titanic')`)
- Similar structure to the [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 📁 Files Included

| File Name                      | Description                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `Titanic_EDA_Task2.py`        | Python script with all analysis     |
| `titanic.csv`                 | Dataset (optional if using seaborn) |
| `Titanic_EDA_Charts_CST_DS_02.png` | Combined visualization output  |
| `README.md`                   | This documentation file             |

## 📈 EDA Visualizations

The script generates a 2x2 grid of EDA charts:
- ✅ Survival Count
- ✅ Survival by Gender
- ✅ Age Distribution
- ✅ Correlation Heatmap

---

## 🔎 Key Insights

- 👩 Female passengers had higher survival rates.
- 🎟️ Higher class and fare passengers were more likely to survive.
- 🧒 Majority of passengers were in the 20–30 age range.

## 📚 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
